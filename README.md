Hi, I'm Harold — a software engineer with 10+ years of experience in C++, Python, and backend systems. I'm currently transitioning into freelance work with a focus on building practical, real-world applications using machine learning, data analysis, and fullstack web development (React, Next.js, Python).

This repository serves as my personal project hub, where I document and share what I'm building as I level up in AI and web technologies.
